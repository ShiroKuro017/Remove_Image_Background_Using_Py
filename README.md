# Remove_Image_Background_Using_Py
Remove image background using library `rembg` in Python with two different approaches (`PIL` and `cv2`)

### How to use: 
1. Upload Image to folder with name **input.png**
2. Run the script


## The output with `PIL`:
<img width="1188" height="684" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61923f1e-3e15-45ae-98e7-519fcc730dd1" />

## The output with `cv2`:
<img width="1188" height="684" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66a35b34-3c06-4214-8d21-9532b118d6ca" />
